Here I present in a nutshell everything involved within the realm of Full Stack Web Development. 

** This is an ever-evolving document. so check back often for updates. **


## Frontend Development
A Front-End Developer is someone who creates websites and web applications. 
The difference between Front-End and Back-End is that Front-End refers to how a web page looks, while back-end refers to how it works. 
You can think of Front-End as client side and Back-End as server-side.

- ### 0 Mindset

  - The Subconscious mind and your beliefs
    - You must first believe you can become a web developer!
    - Every action you take comes from your subconscious and your beliefs! If you think in your mind that you can't do something you NEVER will be able to.
     
  - How to think like a programmer
  - Programming is about problem-solving and using critical thinking skills.

- ### 1 Basics

  - #### How to take Notes like a Sir
    - As a web developer you need to be a master note-taker. There are so many small moving parts and things to learn in web development that you need a system for taking in information, assimilating it, and then documenting it. For this I use Markdown.

    - #### Cornell Note-taking system
      -
      
    - cherrytree
    - keep note
    - **Markdown.md**
      - Why Use Markdown?
        - Markdown can be used for everything. People use it to create websites, documents, notes, books, presentations, email messages, and technical documentation.
        - Markdown is portable. Files containing Markdown formatted text can be opened using virtually any application
        - Markdown is platform independent
        - Markdown is future-proof
        - Markdown is everywhere
